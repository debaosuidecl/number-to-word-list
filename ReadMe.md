# MY WORD PREDICTOR PROJECT

In this project, I built a Word Predictor Application  with React/Redux and NodeJS according to the instructions of the interview.

## INSTALLATION OF DEPENDENCIES

* In the root directory run:
```js script
     npm install
```
* In the client directory also run 

```js script
     npm install
```

You have now installed all the required dependencies for the file



## RUNNING THE APPLICATION
To run the application, in the root directory run:

```js script
     npm start
```


In the client directory run:

```js script
     npm run dev
```

Now you have a running application! Hooray!
